<! Amy's notes and changes:
Corrected several spelling mistakes. 
Corrected grammar when the original was intelligible enough for me to understand what it was trying to say.
Added additional text explaining how to use the page
Changed page from referencing index.js to indexAmy.js, so it would include changes I made there
Added comments to several lines to verify my understanding
